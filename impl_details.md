## UniDonate - Overview

The solution represents a decentralized system designed for public donations through Bitcoin. All components of the system are 100% on-chain powered by the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). To interact with the Bitcoin network, the system internally leverages [IC Bitcoin integration](https://wiki.internetcomputer.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Integration). All backend and smart contracts are written in Motoko. For the frontend part, SveltKit was chosen. At the moment, the system only interacts with the testnet Bitcoin network due to current limitations.
